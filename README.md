GW2 Event Notifier
==================

This application creates notification for upcoming in-game events in form of popups (like Steam messages, nothing game blocking).

It is necessary that you play Guild Wars 2 windowed or in "Windowed Fullscreen" mode.

Furthermore are you required to change the map manually. The Guild Wars 2 API may allows to find your position in the future.
To make that as easy as possible I am working on an Hotkey and UI to easily find and change the current map.

This application uses the official [Guild Wars 2 API](https://forum-en.guildwars2.com/forum/community/api/API-Documentation) and isn't even near complete.
