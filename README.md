GW2 Event Notifier
==================

This application creates notification for upcoming in-game events in form of popups (like Steam messages, nothing game blocking).

It is necessary that you play Guild Wars 2 windowed or in "Windowed Fullscreen" mode.

Furthermore are you required to change the map manually.<br />
In-game you can just press CTRL+Backspace. A dialog will pop up to easily search a map by it's name.

The Guild Wars 2 API may allow to find your position in the future. Until then there is no other way.
